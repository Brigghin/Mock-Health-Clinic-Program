# Mock-Health-Clinic-Program

#This was a project that I created in SENG 265 (Softwear Development Methods) at the University of Victoria

#This project uses a MVC design in order to store, display, and alter patient data, and uses JSON and the Pickle module in order to support data persistance and secure storage for patient information. It also utilizes the PyQt6 library for the UI, and was tested using Pythons unittest framework in order to ensure proper funcionality.

#In order to run, download the clinic folder, ensure you have PyQt6 installed (in the cmd run "pip3 install pyqt6" then in cmd navigate to the Mock-Health-Clinic-Program-main folder and run "python -m clinic gui"
